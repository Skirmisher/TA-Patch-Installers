PATCH INSTALLER TODO
-write install routines: copy files (launcher, recorder, replayer), start DLL for moving maps, 
-write uninstaller to undo the things
-figure out what else the old patch installer does [logs are in repo root]
  -it shoves irrelevant junk files into folders--need to investigate [just reverse the "restore_junk.cmd" thing]
-uninstall old patch/resources first, but maybe retain settings and try to do it silently (I'll look at Windows Installer docs)
-mod migration from old system
-shortcuts for launcher and replayer, file registration for .tad
-set up system to patch patch/resources

COMPLETED (newest first)
-the goddamn directories page...took a lot of reinventing the wheel, but finally got it nice and neat
