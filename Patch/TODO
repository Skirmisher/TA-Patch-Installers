PATCH INSTALLER TODO
-write uninstaller to undo the things
-figure out what else the old patch installer does [logs have been recorded...]
  -it shoves irrelevant junk files into folders--need to investigate [see notes.txt]
-uninstall old patch/resources first, but maybe retain settings and try to do it silently (I'll look at Windows Installer docs)
-mod migration from old system
-shortcuts for launcher and replayer, file registration for .tad
-set up system to patch patch/resources
-upgrade mode: remove directories page, replace with confirmation page?
  -maybe eventually I'll write a registry fixer/modification tool, for people that are lazy but also want to change their TA directory
-Windows uninstall registration
-improve directory creation/removal (for common dirs): multiple subdirs at once, remove all empty parents if install interrupted

COMPLETED (newest first)
-change resources incompatibility version check to accept resources installer file like the fresh-install functionality, because the resources installer has the same check and we don't want a paradox :P
-write basic install routines: copy files (launcher, recorder, replayer), start DLL for moving maps,
-the goddamn directories page...took a lot of reinventing the wheel, but finally got it nice and neat
