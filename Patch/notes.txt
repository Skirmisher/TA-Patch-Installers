Launcher and Replayer should go to created subdirs in OTA directory
i.e.
C:\CAVEDOG\TOTALA\Replayer
C:\CAVEDOG\TOTALA\Launcher

totala2.hpi, ccmaps.ufo/ccx, and maps chosed by user via the DLL dialog
DOCUMENTS\My Games\Total Annihilation\Maps

ccdata.ccx, TA_Features_2013.ccx, totala1.hpi
ROOT OF OTA\CommonData

Once installed:
Execute modstool.exe -add "-i:0" "-n:Backward Compatibility" "-p:C:\CAVEDOG\TOTALA\TotalA.exe"
Execute modstool.exe -add "-i:1" "-n:Total Annihilation" "-v:3.9.3" "-p:C:\CAVEDOG\TOTALA\TotalA.exe" "-r:TA Patch"
where -p has to be set to correct OTA location
