Welcome to the TA Unofficial Patch installer project! This README file will eventually contain sufficient documentation for you to get a grasp on the workings of the installers and get started with them. I'll fill in documentation as I get the time.

You can view the roadmap for each individual installer by reading the TODO files in each directory.

Third-party plugins used: nsProcess ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NsProcess_plugin ), MD5 plugin ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MD5_plugin ), Inetc ( http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in )
