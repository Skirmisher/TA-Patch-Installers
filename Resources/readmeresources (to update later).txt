Total Annihilation Patch Resources v1.0 (October 2, 2013)

http://www.tauniverse.com

---------- Introduction --------------------------------------

This is the resources component of the TA Unofficial Patch and is required for the installation of the TA Patch and any mods based on the TA Patch. When the TA Patch or such mods are attempted to be installed before the TA Patch Resources are installed, they will provide the option to automatically download and install the TA Patch Resources before continuing with their own installation.

The TA Patch Resources contains the components of the TA Unofficial Patch that are unlikely to be updated regularly, if ever. Therefore, separating these components into a separate package ensures that the TA Patch can be regularly updated without forcing the user to re-download the same 162 MB of patch resources over and over.

The TA Patch Resources package contains the following items:

- The 16 official downloadable maps released by Cavedog on the official TA website.

- The TA music in MP3 format, for use with the TA Patch's ability to play music from the game folder instead of the game disc. You can customize the game music by following the instructions in the /tamus folder.

- The TA Map Features 2013 pack which contains all known map features, allowing users to play on almost every custom map ever created.

- The TA AIs 2013 pack which contains all known map-specific AIs, allowing users to enjoy these maps as intended by the designer.

- The TA Map Weapons 2013 pack which contains map weapons that may be necessary to play certain custom maps. These are not installed by default; please read the separate TA_Map_Weapons_2013_readme.txt file for more information.

---------- Installation --------------------------------------

Simply run the installer and follow the instructions.

Please note that you MUST install to a valid game folder and that the game folder chosen to install the TA Patch Resources will be the same folder that the the TA Patch and TA Patch based mods will be installed to. You CANNOT install the TA Patch or TA Patch based mods to a different location.

Do not uninstall the TA Patch Resources while the TA Patch is installed. If you wish to uninstall, the proper procedure is to uninstall the TA Patch first and then the TA Patch Resources.
