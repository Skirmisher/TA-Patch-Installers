We don't want to support warez installations so we are going to use registry paths that are made by Cavedog setup or GOG installer

HKLM "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DirectPlay\Applications\Total Annihilation" "Path"
HKLM "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Total Annihilation" "Dir"


Shared patch settings :
HKCU "Software\TA Patch" "CommonGameDataPath"
HKCU "Software\TA Patch" "CommonMapsPath"
